# solo project: fu-is-wow

let's try to build something!

1. Identify your user(s): 
- Joey Ma

2. What is the problem youâ€™re solving?
- Identify what stocks to buy and when to buy them

3. What is the solution? 
- Create a web page that acts like a board, with each board being a stock / company that you can add, display the stock price in a chart, and have a way for each stock to have its own notes.

4. What is the MVP scope? (core features you must get working)
- Have a basic web page (built using html, css, react), hopefully not TOO basic
- Have a mechanism to update page (using express / redux)
- Be able to fetch from api to get current stock prices, etc. 

5. What are the tough technical challenges involved with solving this problem?
- TBD.

6. What are the stretch goals?
- Be able to graph the the stock prices
- add several useful fields such as indicators of when to buy / sell a stock
- Allow anyone who visits the site the ability to create his/her own profile and keep track of his/her own boards
